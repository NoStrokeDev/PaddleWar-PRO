# PaddleWar-PRO
Welcome to our GitHub page. We are developing a simple PaddleWar game, but ours is the PaddleWar PRO.
You can download our beta versions until we have released the first stable-release. They are in the folder called "public betas".
Optionally, you can also become an internal beta tester and get access to our development-betas to give us your best possible support and help make our game better. Visit beta.emon.at for more information.
Important: Our beta versions can be used without installation and leave no traces on your macOS or Windows system.
